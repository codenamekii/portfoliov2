  about:
    "Yo, I'm Taufiqurrahman —  just a fresh grad tryna survive the dev game. Lately diving deep into cloud computing and DevOps to stay sharp and relevant in this fast-moving tech industry. When I’m not working with Laravel, you’ll find me breaking down system architecture, debugging student projects, or keeping an eye on campus IoT tools. My code is mostly backend- focused, but I’ve been exploring deployment workflows and CI/CD pipelines. Principle’s simple: *build it clean, make it work, keep it useful*. GitHub? [@codenamekii](https:/ / github.com / codenamekii) — that’s where the magic(and chaos) lives.Outside of tech, I mess around with renewable energy stuff, listen to lo - fi, and occasionally binge old Steve Jobs keynotes.Clean code isn't a preference — it’s a damn rule!.",
  bio: "Yo, I’m a web developer fresh outta [Makassar](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FJwtdqT7wAsTZSBH9), still figuring things out post-graduation. Been building with Laravel, messing around with servers, and breaking stuff on the regular just to learn how to fix it again. My GitHub’s like my second brain — all bugs, no sleep — catch me [here](https://github.com/codenamekii). Most of my days are spent automating stuff, shipping broken features, and pretending to know what CI/CD means.\n\n Off the screen, I vibe with lo-fi beats, late-night Reddit rabbit holes, and fixing random electronics I probably shouldn’t be touching. I post random updates or techy stuff on [IG](https://www.instagram.com/callmefiki/), but mostly I’m just trying to not go insane while chasing this dev life. Not saving the world or anything, just tryna keep the code clean and the coffee strong.",
  career:
    "I started as a self-taught developer at the age of 14, while I was in 8th grade and it's been a rollercoaster ride since then. Am aka [SkidGod](https://dub.sh/skidgod) on the internet. Won't you ask me what does it mean? [Click here to know](/about).",
  careerFull:
    "I began my journey as a self-taught developer at 14, during 8th grade, and it's been a rollercoaster ever since. Online, I'm known as [SkidGod](https://dub.sh/skidgod), a name that reflects my roots—starting as an unskilled 'skid' using others' scripts.\n\nBack in 2019, I was just an average school kid with little tech knowledge. When the pandemic hit, everything moved online, and I got a Redmi 8 for attending classes. But, I quickly turned it into a gaming device, getting hooked on ***Free Fire***. This led me to join Discord gaming servers, where I discovered the world of Discord bots.\n\nI met a guy named Priyanshu, the creator of the 'Groot' bot, and got inspired. I spent a year skidding code on Replit, eventually learning Python. I then built a successful Discord bot, 'Floater,' with over 3 million users and 5,000 servers. Despite being bullied for being a 'skid,' I embraced the name SkidGod and started contributing to open-source Discord bots.\n\nAnd that's how my career began.",
